We're renting out our 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment in Downtown due to relocation.
(includes parking and locker).
The area is really cool (and most importantly, very quiet for Toronto). You get the downtown vibe but in a peaceful setting. It's on Logan Street, surrounded by private houses, lots of cafes, restaurants, and great transportation options.
The balcony offers a view of the CN Tower and the entire city.
The building is brand new, we're the first occupants, everything is in perfect condition. Parking and locker are included in the price. There's a gym, coworking space, barbecue area, and outdoor relaxation zone.
Two bedrooms, one master bedroom (with ensuite bathroom), and the other separate from the bathroom. Can be used as a bedroom or office, whatever you prefer.
Landlords are great, quick to respond to any questions or requests, and hands-off if everything is okay
If you want to see the apartment, message me privately.

Hello Future Renter!
Available for April 1, 2024, our beautifully renovated Basement Apartment is perfect for a young couple, working professional or a mature student.
Entire Apartment has been updated with new flooring, baseboards and doors throughout the space. Upon Entry, you will find convenient coat hooks, a floating shelf for your hats and gloves and a bench that folds up. Special feature: move in your long pieces of furniture using the pass-through located under the bench!
Follow the white block feature wall down the stairs (which has a sturdy, yet removable railing to make move-in day super easy) to the Kitchen! Newly installed cabinets allow for lots of counter space and plenty of drawers. In addition, there is a pantry directly off the kitchen with shelving and additional storage space. (And if that’s not enough, you’ll find additional storage under the stairs - Harry Potter would be jealous!) The kitchen passthrough makes it easy to entertain your guests while prepping in the kitchen (or, let’s be honest, will allow you to watch TV while you cook!).
Walk under the Raw Wood Beams into the Living Room/Dining Room, which is very spacious with lots of light. There’s enough floor space to dance like no one’s watching (and lucky for you, there are wood blinds you can close to make sure no one does!)
Down the Hallway, you’ll find a small Den/Office on the left, in-suite Laundry on the right and the Master Bedroom* straight ahead. The master is quite spacious and could even allow an additional workspace if needed. These rooms are awaiting your touch to make them special!
Finally, the 3 Piece Bathroom has a new vanity, standing shower (sorry, no tub) and a toilet. 2 reclaimed wood shelves and 3 hooks are provided along with a linen closet in the hall.
As for location, this is a great one! 5 minute walk to the Oshawa Centre, Grocery Store, Trent University, Civic Centre and Go Bus Stop. 10 minute drive to the Go Station, 401, Lowes, Walmart, Starbucks and Banking.
