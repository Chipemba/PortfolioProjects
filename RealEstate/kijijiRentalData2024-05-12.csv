We have pay stubs and employment letters.We are very quiet and clean tenants. We do have 1 Cat who is trained so the home must be pet friendly.

I am looking for someone to take over my apartment lease (9 months remaining). The apartment is under rent control, so even after lease expire in 9 months, you can stay on month to month rent basis.
I was working at University of Toronto for last 2 years and have been living in this apartment since then. Due to getting a new job offer, I am required to move to a different part of Ontario.
Information about the apartment:
- Spadina Subway station entrance is literally in front of the apartment, not even 15 meters away.
- Free parking - yes this apartment has parking in the back which is not regulated. This is unheard of in downtown Toronto, however, I have been parking my car for free for last 2 years. You also have the option to park underground which is charged, however, I do not suggest parking underground and make use of free parking outside.
- This apartment is in the basement level if you taking the elevator, however, from the pictures you can see all windows are fully at the main level and all rooms are fully lit up with natural sunlight. This is the reason why this apartment is very cheap at this location and will all these amenities.
- This is a one bedroom apartment and the elevator is literally next to the apartment door, It's very convenient. The apartment has a full kitchen with new dishwasher, new huge fridge, microwave, etc., all included.
- Has a full washroom with large mirror.
- I used to live in an apartment above paying a higher rent, however, got the opportunity to get this apartment in February 2024. So there is only 9 months lease left, meaning it's kind of a short term lease with the option to keep living on month to month rent basis. Also as mentiones above, this apartment is under rent control which mean rent will not increase over the contolled rate.
Please contact me if you are interested in this apartment. I might be at work during the day, so I might only reply back in the afternoon, sorry about that.","['No: Hydro', 'Yes: Heat', 'No: Water', 'No: Water']",1,1 Year,Yes,600,No,"['', 'Laundry (In Building)', 'Dishwasher', 'Fridge / Freezer']",Yes,,"['', '', '', '24 Hour Security', 'Bicycle Parking', 'Storage Space', 'Elevator in Building']"

Additional Information: I am a queer single woman with two cats seeking a calm, quiet housemate. Preference for 2SLGBTQIA housemate. I’ve lived here for three years and love the space and neighbourhood. I just can’t afford the rent on my own. I trained in the arts, but now work a 9-5 in a medical office. Hazel and Juniper are loving, friendly cats. Hazel is almost 12, so she can be slow to warm up. Juniper is nearly 2 and loves everyone. I don’t think other cats would work out, but we did live with a small dog for a year and the girls got along well.

My name is Kyel, my partner Snow and I are looking to secure long term housing (1 year) near Oakville while I finish my program at Sheridan College(2025 grad).
Our budget is $2100, utilities included is preferred, max $2200. We can provide proof of income and references.
We are looking for:
- 2 bedrooms for office space to work from home when needed
- 1 bathroom is enough for us!
- we are plant lovers, so lots of natural light is preferred to keep our plants healthy after the move
- also animal lovers, so pet friendly is a must!
We aren’t allowed pets right now which is why we are looking to move into a place that allows cats and dogs to coexist
- having a yard, or access to community garden would be preferable so we can let our dog out to exercise and garden
- laundry in unit/building would be amazing
- NO BASEMENTS PLEASE ! We need an apartment with natural light ☀️
- oakville, area near sheridan college
- 1 parking spot for my car
We are hoping to find a landlord that is understanding of social issues and willing to support us as a young couple in “buying” our first “house” together.
Considering the housing market has changed a lot, this is the closest we will get to buying our own home for a while.
Having secure long-term housing will give us the opportunity to find better jobs and save up for our future.

If the ad is still up the property has not been leased yet.
We are looking for a great tenant(s) to commence occupancy upon signing a 1 year lease for June 1st 2024 to May 31st 2025 with the option to renew upon request no later than 2 months before the conclusion of the signed lease.
Things one should know:
-Monthly rent does not include internet.
-Tenant(s) MUST have a renters insurance policy. (Referrals avaliable upon request)
-Tenant(s) are also responsible for covering monthly electricity usage. Bill will be forwarded by email on a monthly basis.
-Absolutely NO smoking or vaping at all.
-No parties or loud music that will disturb neighbours.
-No occupants to reside in property who are not listed as tenants on the lease.
(Short-term ""friend from abroad""/weekend sleepovers are fine)
-No wallmounting TVs or drilling holes into drywall unless this is coordinated with us beforehand. (Damage to drywall will be deducted from deposit for failure to abide by set out conditions)
-Must consult before any DIY projects. Including the painting of walls or mounting of shelves and such.
Things one should have:
-Proof of income/letter of employment
-Proof of credit history i.e equifax
-Proof of identity
-Professional Reference
(no family or personal friends for reference)
-Previous landlord reference (very helpful and advantegous for positioning you as a strong candidate for tenancy but if not possible that is understandable and documented proof of timely rent payments alongside old copy of lease agreement should suffice)
-If you are a first time renter disregard landlord/rent payment reference but consider the fact that by moving ahead with an inquiry another party may be a better fit in our eyes due to the other party having the aforementioned point.
Things one should expect:
-Potential raise in rent in the event of a lease renewal at a rate at or below the set out legal limit in accordance with setout law and rent control guidelines
-We (the landlords and tenant(s)) will videotape and photograph the entirety of the unit together on our devices and agree to the final footage on each of our devices to then proceed to email each other copies of said footage for the purpose of retaining time stamped records to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the unit is vacated in a condition that satisfies the one in which it was initially occupied upon lease commencement
-Upon approval after satisfying the outlined criteria we (the landlords) will meet in the condo management office with you (the tenant(s)) in order to have you registered. (If you have a vehicle you will need to provide the information pertaining to it to the property manager to register it with the parking spot)
-After everything is completed we will then ACCEPT AND ONLY THEN accept your first and last payment ($1750&$1750) alongside your security deposit of $500.00 in the form of an e-transfer since that will give us all a time stamped record of payment which is in everyones best interests.
To elaborate, after you sign the hardcopy of the lease (that you will be emailed in advance to review prior to signing in person in the management office since the property manager will sign the witness signature element of the lease) you will be handed the keys to the unit as well as the fob keys to the unit in the management office in exchange for the passwords to the e-transfers covering the outlined amount of the respective first/last/security deposit.
Subsequent e-transfers for the monthly rent payments are to be sent no later than the date in which the signing of the hardcopy lease and the remittance of the first e-transfer(s) takes place as planned and coordinated in the management office (fourth week of May 2024)
